                                 I am an undergraduate Engineering student with leadership experience 
                                 and an background from a project-based, human-centered, 
                                 and design-driven curriculum. I will graduate from James Madison University 
                                 in May of 2020 with a B.S. in Engineering with systems focus. I have various 
                                 experiences in project management, detailed systems analysis, customer interaction,
                                  troubleshooting, product testing and engineering design. My experiences give me a 
                                  hardworking and goal-oriented mindset nested in creative thinking. I aim to use my 
                                  ills and passions to collaboratively design sustainable solutions in the engineering 
                                  fields.

                                 I am curious and competitive by nature and 
                                 i am fortunate to grow up in circumstances that have allowed me to learn. 
                                 As an earnest learner my natural habit have been to consume knowledge from multitude
                                  sources. I have learned from mixture of online tutorials, videos, books and 
                                  nversations with people.
