                            highest rated and most reviewed. 
                            This app uses React JS, HTML/CSS, Node JS and yelp API to find the desired restaurant.

                            <CardText>
                            My introduction to programming was through 
                            developing games via simplegui library. 
                            This introductory class was design centric and a project based course. 
                            Through this class I learned to develop 
                            fundamental programming skills in python, 
                            detect and resolve bugs, write good code and develope good coding habits.
                            The final project was to build the asteroid game 
                            this was an comprehensive design project, 
                            which combined many of the skills that i had developed throughout the course.

                            This is a project part of the Principle Of Computing course. 
                            The essence of the project demonstrates the application 
                            of the search algorithm. This is done by building a zombie 
                            apocalypse game. The game consists of zombies, human, and obstacles. 
                            The goal is to keep the humans alive by building obstacles that inhibit 
                            zombies movement. The zombies can move up, down, left and right. 
                            Humans can move in any direction.

                                    Python Project- The Stock Market</CardTitle>
                                <CardText>
                                This is a project that I completed in January of 2019. 
                                Itâ€™s a numerical stock analysis using Numpy, Sklearn, Beautiful Soup and Pandas library in python. 
                                The essence of the project is to 
                                forecast stock prices through patterns that 
                                might have occurred in previous years. 
                                This is done by comparing and contrasting array 
                                of stocks to the one that is of interest and finding a 
                                positive correlation, using this correlation and machine 
                                learning algorithms it might be possible to 
                                predict the price of a stock a day or two days ahead. 
                                This is a very rudimentary hypothesis and through several test and iterations, 
                                it can be concluded that it is very hard to predict the future.
                                But this script incorporates a lot of different 
                                elements and it is a foundation for building more robust algorithms.
